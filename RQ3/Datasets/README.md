# Datasets

## Dataset1

Dataset1 is used for comparing Matrioska and VAHunt performance with respect to their ability to detect virtualization engines inside apps. Thus, Dataset1 contains 50 apps that use the virtualization technique (i.e., the true positives) and 50 apps that do not use the virtualization technique (i.e., the true negatives). All apps were collected from the Google Play Store.

## Dataset2

Dataset2 contains 152,602 malware samples used for comparing Matrioska and VAHunt performance with respect to their ability to detect a virtualization-based repackaging malware. We collected the malware by first downloading 800,000 malwares from AndroZoo having a VirusTotal score equal to or greater than 10/66 and published after January 2018. We then removed duplicate samples with identical package names, saving only the most recent version. Due to dimension issues, the whole Dataset2 has been splitted in 4 separate csv files.
