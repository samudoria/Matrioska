# RQ2: How prevalent are the current detection and defence mechanisms against VBR malwares?

The `2account_virtualization_detection` directory contains datasets, compiled code, and scripts to answer RQ2, as presented in Section 5.1 of the paper. Since VAHunt is a static analysis tool, we did not measure its adoption.  
Furthermore, we did not find any app embedding MARVEL.
